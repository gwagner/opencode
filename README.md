| bug-fixer | Diagnoses defects and adds regression coverage. |
| code-implementor | Implements focused, evidence-based code changes. |
| code-spec-engineer | Produces implementation-ready feature specifications. |
| opencode-optimizer | Audits OpenCode agents and skills. |
| postgres-schema-designer | Designs PostgreSQL schema specifications. |
| prd-strategist | Creates and refines OKF requirements. |

## Graphify

Code-oriented agents may load `graphify` only when `graphify-out/graph.json` exists. The skill selects focused graph queries before broad reports or raw source search, and updates the graph after relevant code changes.
